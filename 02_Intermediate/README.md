# 02_Intermediate: Advanced Types and Concurrency

This module is the bridge to becoming a solid Go developer. You will learn the foundational concepts of concurrency, error handling, JSON manipulation, and Web APIs.

## Modules

* **`01_interfaces`**: Polymorphism in Go. Defining behavior rulebooks without inheritance.
* **`02_error_handling`**: Rethinking errors as standard return values instead of structural exceptions.
* **`03_custom_errors`**: Building custom error structs to track metadata alongside errors.
* **`04_generics`**: Writing functions and structs that accept any type (`T any`) introduced in Go 1.18.
* **`05_goroutines`**: Spawning lightweight, concurrent execution threads with the `go` keyword.
* **`06_channels`**: Safely passing data between goroutines to prevent race conditions.
* **`07_waitgroups`**: Blocking the main thread until a dynamic amount of worker goroutines finish entirely.
* **`08_mutex`**: Locking and unlocking memory state (`sync.Mutex`) to prevent simultaneous read/write corruption.
* **`09_json`**: Marshalling and Unmarshalling `struct` tags into REST API payloads.
* **`10_modules`**: Dependency management and writing internal packages spanning multiple files.
* **`11_building_api`**: Putting it all together into a standard Library HTTP REST API with CRUD routes.
